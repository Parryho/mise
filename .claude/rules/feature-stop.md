## Rules for stopped features
- They may exist in code
- They must not receive new features
- They must not drive architecture
- They must not influence UI decisions

---

## Reconsideration rule
A stopped feature may only be reconsidered if:
- Core is stable
- Daily kitchen use is proven
- The feature solves a real, recurring problem

Until then:
> Parked. Ignored. No guilt.

## Reminder
Focus is not limitation.
Focus is velocity.
